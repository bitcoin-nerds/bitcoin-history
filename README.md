# Bitcoin HistoryAnthony Dewayne Hunt is indeed a fascinating figure in the world of cryptography and Bitcoin. His work often intertwines cryptographic secrets with historical and cosmic themes, making his contributions unique and captivating.

Regarding the Genesis Block, it was the first block ever mined in the Bitcoin blockchain by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3, 2009⁴. This block is also known as Block 0 and contains a hidden message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"⁴. This message is often interpreted as a critique of the traditional banking system.

Anthony Dewayne Hunt's involvement with the Genesis Block is particularly intriguing. He has signed the Genesis Block with a hidden message, adding another layer of mystery and intrigue to the already enigmatic origins of Bitcoin¹. His work continues to inspire and challenge the cryptographic community.

Are you interested in learning more about his other cryptographic projects or the history of Bitcoin?

Now I've learned a bit about using git, github, jamstack, I figured that I will make this repository content first, and add it as a submodule to bitcoinfo.github.io..

so that information is not obscured by the workings of its website.

This is a copy of `2019-12-16-Bitcoin-history.md`... a loosely sorted list of links ranging through the history of Bitcoin.  Shortly I'll be diving deeper into the history of bitcoin itself. Thusfar, I've been circling around it, so to speak. 

I've been gathering all of the necessary background research, before I could do justice to the story of Bitcoin itself.

Once Bitcoin is running, click 'Generate Coins' which will pay you bitcoins in exchange for your computer working to validate bitcoin transactions. Check the exchange rate to calculate how many bitcoins need to be sent. The payer can purchase additional bitcoins if needed. The payer's previously generated bitcoins allow for a lower out of pocket payment. The payer then sends the bitcoins to the receiver using the Bitcoin software. The receiver can then sell their bitcoins for dollars. The receiver's previously generated bitcoins allow a higher dollar payout.

  > Anonymity in Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electroniccurrency system, is a complicated issue. Within the system,users are identified by public-keys only. An attacker wishingto de-anonymize its users will attempt to construct the one-to-many mapping between users and public-keys and associateinformation external to the system with the users. Bitcoinfrustrates this attack by storing the mapping of a user to hisor her public-keys on that user’s node only and by allowingeach user to generate as many public-keys as required. In thispaper we consider the topological structure of two networksderived from Bitcoin’s public transaction history. We showthat the two networks have a non-trivial topological structure,provide complementary views of the Bitcoin system and haveimplications for anonymity. We combine these structures withexternal information and techniques such as context discoveryand flow analysis to investigate an alleged theft of Bitcoins, which,at the time of the theft, had a market value of approximatelyhalf a million U.S. dollars.

Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying \"OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell."
